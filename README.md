<strong>Description</strong>: This project analyzes crimes in Los Angeles, CA from a period of 2010 to 2023. 2.7 million entries were documented and made available to the public from the Los Angeles Police Department. Data cleaning, analysis, and reporting was conducted to determine and showcase interesting findings related to patterns in criminal activity. A distinct analysis was also conducted to consider any unique impacts the COVID-19 pandemic had on the year 2020 and itsâ€™ surrounding years

<strong>Questions and Answers</strong>: Questions were mainly centered around finding any interesting patterns or unique results returned from the data. Analyzing varying year groupings, the occurrences of each documented crime, and looking at changes of criminal activity between police stations. 

Results from both the entire investigation, as well as the investigation specific to COVID-19 returned interesting findings. Theft was continually one of the most popular crimes for Los Angeles, with varying types of theft increasing by up to 95%. Police stations also saw continually changing rates in criminal activity, twenty-one different police stations were analyzed and their total number of crimes and any significate changes were reported.


<strong>Application of Knowledge</strong>: This exploration of crime analysis in Los Angeles, CA resulted in the understanding that many of the same crimes occurred over the thirteen-year period.
This insight could be utilized to implement more preventative measures in an attempt to reduce the rate of these crimes. Preventative measures could come in the form of public information and awareness, or increased resources widely available to the public.
